# Simple Demo App

This demo app demonstrates how to use this component.

# Development

Because the packager [does not support symlinks at the moment](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/637), we have to use a custom nodemon workaround to use this app for development. After starting React Native use the following command to keep the module in sync.

`nodemon nodemon.json`
