# Simple Demo App

This demo app demonstrates how to use this component.

```
$ npm install
$ react-native run-[ios|android]
```

# Development

Use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to keep the module in sync with `node_modules` of this example app:

```
$ npm install
$ react-native run-[ios|android]
$ npm run nodemon
```

You can now edit the files in `../`, and they will be synced to `node_modules/react-native-modal-selector/`
